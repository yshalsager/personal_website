## Android Software Development

Also, I have a good history of Android software development since 2014 on [XDA-Developers Forums](https://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php?u=6084385).  
Some of my previous works are:

*   **Android Custom ROMs development**: I used to be involved in the development of Android custom ROMs for devices I own, such as [Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro](https://forum.xda-developers.com/redmi-note-5-pro/development/rom-liquidremix-v10-0-xiaomi-note-5-pro-t3865413), and [Xiaomi Mi Max](https://forum.xda-developers.com/mi-max/development/rom-lineageos-15-1-t3756521).  
    Then, when Android Oreo (8.0) brought [Project Treble](https://forum.xda-developers.com/project-treble), I wrote a guide about how to build a Generic System Image (GSI) on your own [here](https://forum.xda-developers.com/project-treble/trebleenabled-device-discussion/guide-how-to-build-project-treble-gsi-t3801803) and maintained a couple of GSI ROMs ([XenonHD](https://forum.xda-developers.com/project-treble/trebleenabled-device-development/8-1-0-xenonhd-t3800543) and [BenzoROM](https://forum.xda-developers.com/project-treble/trebleenabled-device-development/gsi-benzo-rom-9-0-t3837127)) for some good time.
    
*   **Custom Recovery ports**: I have ported Custom recovery like [TWRP](https://github.com/TeamWin/) and [Redwolf](https://github.com/RedWolfRecovery) for many devices like [Lenovo Phab 2 Pro (PB2-690Y)](https://forum.xda-developers.com/phab-2-pro/development/recovery-twrp-lenovo-phab-2-pro-pb2-690y-t4012893), [Cubot X18 Plus](https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/development/recovery-twrp-cubot-x18-plus-mt6750t-t3806752), [YU Yureka Black](https://forum.xda-developers.com/yu-yureka-black/development/recovery-red-wolf-recovery-project-t3750703), [Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro](https://forum.xda-developers.com/redmi-note-5-pro/development/recovery-red-wolf-recovery-project-t3766997), [Xiaomi Mi Max / Mi Max Pro.](https://forum.xda-developers.com/mi-max/development/recovery-red-wolf-recovery-project-t3750171) when I was part of [TwrpBuilder](https://github.com/TwrpBuilder) project.
    
*   **[DualBootPatcher](https://github.com/chenxiaolong/DualBootPatcher) contributions**: When DualBootPatcher project was actively under development I used to do some contributions like [this guide](https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/software-hacking/guide-dualbootpatcher-build-source-t3663076) about how to bring DualBootPatcher for new Android devices, and added the support of many devices to the project like Nokia X/XL/X2, Samsung Galaxy Win / Core, Xiaomi Mi 6, Mi 4S, Redmi 4A, and Redmi Pro, OnePlus 5, and Samsung Galaxy S8/S8+/Note 8 (Exynos).

## Technical Writing and Translation

I'm an English Translation senior student currently. I have a good experience in translating various technical stuff into Arabic. You can find a partial list of the translations done by me [here](https://github.com/yshalsager-localizations/Index).

Also, I have been writing at Loghat Al-Asr magazine (Al-Ahram, Egypt) since 2015 as a part of their internship for undergraduate students.  
As of July 2020, my published articles are more than 70 articles, which can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qpBAYudAw_LM2bicHGQ1PgiKoFk_lf2r/view?usp=sharing).
