Hi there! I'm Youssif (or better known as yshalsager on the internet), XiaomiFirmwareUpdater Project Lead Developer, XDA Recognized Developer, Self-taught Programmer, and writer at Loghat El-asr magazine.

I've been coding in Python since 2018, mostly for web scraping, automation, chat bots, and building other cool [projects](/en/projects) (most of them are open-source and available on GitHub).

Also, I've been tinkering with Android software development since 2014, building mods, custom recoveries, and custom ROMs for Android devices. You can find my android related works on [XDA-Developers Forums](https://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php?u=6084385).

You can checkout my projects [here](/en/projects), and if you would like to contact me here's [how to reach me out](/en/contact).

You can also download a copy from my resume from [here](/Youssif_Shaaban_yshalsager_Resume.pdf).
